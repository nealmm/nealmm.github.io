			I was fascinated by technology in general from an early age and have followed that sense of
			curiosity to this day. I was lured into programming by a desire to make games and quickly
			became enthralled by the possibilities of what one could build with just a compiler and their
			imagination. From my time at college I developed a deeper appreciation for mathematics and the
			theory of computation, with a particular interest in programming language theory. These days I
			spend my time trying to keep up with the never-ending accretion of web technologies and
			setting up this blog.
